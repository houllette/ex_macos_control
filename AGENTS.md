WRITE ALL TEMPORARY FILES INTO ./tmp/ - this includes all markdown based implementation planning documents

IMPORTANT: DO NOT commit or push AI-generated implementation plans, completion notes, or quickstart guides to the git repository. These working documents should ONLY be written to ./tmp/ directory which is gitignored. The user does not want AI-written documentation in version control.
